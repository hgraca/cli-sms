 * value: It will explicitly tell us that an object implementing this interface is an event, and it was designed with
 * the intention of being used with the event dispatcher. We will also know that any object not implementing this
 * interface is not designed with the intention of being dispatched by the event dispatcher.
 *
 * Furthermore, it allows us to strong type the argument of the event dispatcher, preventing us from making the mistake
 * of dispatching objects that are not intended to be dispatched by the event dispatcher.
