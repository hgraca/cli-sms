/**
 * This can be used for numeric sequential IDs, for example the ones generated by an auto-increment field in an SQL
 * engine. Ideally, however, we would not use such ID generation. Nevertheless it is common to need to use sequential
 * integer IDs, for example for invoices, and we could either use that as a quick and dirty solution or find another
 * way of generating such sequential IDs.
 *
 * This class could be final instead of abstract, and we could have all entities use this same ID class.
 * However, that would have little more benefit than simply having the entities IDs as simple integers, we would still
 * have the ambiguity of "is this value supposed to be the ID of this entity, or is there a mistake and this is some
 * other value?".
 * What we really want to do is to have a specific ID class for each entity, so that we can type hint to specific
 * classes and remove all ambiguity.
