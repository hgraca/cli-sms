 * This class is here just as an example of another type of ID.
 * This would be useful, for example when our application uses 3rd party systems that provide us with their own (string)
 * IDs, and which we need to store on our system.
 *
 * This class could be final instead of abstract, and we could have all entities use this same ID class.
 * However, that would have little more benefit than simply having the entities IDs as simple integers, we would still
 * have the ambiguity of "is this value supposed to be the ID of this entity, or is there a mistake and this is some
 * other value?".
 * What we really want to do is to have a specific ID class for each entity, so that we can type hint to specific
 * classes and remove all ambiguity.
