/**
 * Exception that represents an error in the program logic. This kind of
 * exceptions should directly lead to a fix in your code.
 *
 * In other words, these are exceptions that can happen, and should be
 * caught somewhere in our code and dealt with elegantly.
 * For example, when a user tries to register with a user name that already
 * exists, the persistence mechanism could throw a specific logic exception
 * which would be caught somewhere and show a nice error message to the user.
 *
 * This exception is in the PhpExtension, which means that it can be used in several projects of the same vendor.
 * Therefore, by catching this exception we might be catching an exception of another library created by
 * the same vendor.
 *
