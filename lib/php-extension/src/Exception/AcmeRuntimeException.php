 * Exception thrown if an error which can only be found at runtime occurs.

 *
 * In other words, these exceptions should never actually be thrown,
 * if they do then there is an error somewhere.
 * They are used only to signal the developers that there is a bug somewhere,
 * so they should not be caught, they should result in an application error.
 *
 * This exception is in the PhpExtension, which means that it can be used in several projects of the same vendor.
 * Therefore, by catching this exception we might be catching an exception of another library created by
 * the same vendor.
